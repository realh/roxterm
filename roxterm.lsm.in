Description:	Multi-tabbed GTK/VTE terminal emulator
		@configure_input@
		ROXTerm is a terminal emulator based on the VTE library. It was
		originally intended to be a lightweight alternative to gnome-terminal,
		but its role has shifted to providing a richer range of features for
		power users. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name implies,
		but also integrates well with other X desktop environments such as
		GNOME.
