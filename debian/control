Description: Transitional package to updgrade roxterm-gtk3 to roxterm
 This is a dummy package to facilitate automatic upgrades from roxterm-gtk3 2.x
 to roxterm 3.x, due to a change in the packaging structure. It may be removed
 once the roxterm 3.x package is installed, but consider also explicitly
 installing roxterm to prevent its accidental removal by autoremove.

 no longer supported, so if you want to continue using that you will have to
 pin an older version.
