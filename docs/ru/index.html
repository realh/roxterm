        <h1>Добро пожаловать</h1>
        <p>ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features
        to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library. It was originally
        designed to have a smaller footprint and quicker start-up time by not
        using the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the
        configuration GUI, but thanks to all the features it's acquired over
        the years ROXTerm can probably now be accused of bloat. However, it is
        more configurable than gnome-terminal and aimed more at "power" users
        who make heavy use of terminals.</p>
        <p>It still supports the ROX desktop application layout it was named
        after, but can also be installed in a more conventional manner for use
        in other desktop environments.</p>

        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <h2>Download <a class="pageAnchor" name="Download" id=
        "Download">:</a></h2>
        <p>Visit the <a href="http://github.com/realh/roxterm">github project
        page</a> to download snapshots. For a stable version use the latest
        numerical tag. If you are using an old LTS distro with a GTK3 version
        lower than 3.20 you should use roxterm 3.3.1, preferably from your
        distro's package manager. In case your distro is really old, roxterm
        2.x supports GTK2.</p>
        <h2>Requirements <a class="pageAnchor" name="Requirements" id=
        "Requirements">:</a></h2>
        <p>You need the libraries for GTK+3 which is pretty much standard on
        all free Unix derivatives these days. It needs at least version 2.16 of
        glib and GTK+ 3.20. You will also need vte/libvte (at least version
        0.48 of vte-2.91), a GNOME component. D-BUS is also required (see
        below).</p>
        <p>To compile ROXTerm you will need the header files for the above
        libraries. In packaging systems they usually come in packages whose
        names end in "-dev" or "-devel".</p>
        <p>Prior to 3.5.0 ROXTerm used a bespoke build system called maitch.
        This requires python and the python 'lockfile' module. 3.5.0 uses the
        more conventional <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>.</p>
        <h3>D-Bus</h3>
        <p>D-Bus is a messaging system which ROXTerm uses to connect terminals
        with its configure tool. ROXTerm uses the "session" bus, which should
        be started along with your desktop environment. Current versions of
        ROX, GNOME and KDE/Plasma session managers all launch D-Bus. If you use
        some other session/desktop/window manager which doesn't launch D-Bus
        you can start it by inserting something like this near the start of
        your .xinitrc or .xsession:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>if test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ;
        then</span> <span class="indented">eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax
        --exit-with-session`</span> <span class="indented">export
        DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</span> <span>fi</span></p>
        <h2>Installing <a class="pageAnchor" name="Installing" id=
        "Installing">:</a></h2>
        <p>To install ROXTerm for ROX all you need to do is check it out or
        unpack it into your Apps directory and run it from there, but you will
        probably want to rename the folder to ROXTerm. For other systems
        ROXTerm may be installed in the typical CMake way:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>mkdir build</span> <span>cd build</span>
        <span>cmake ..</span> <span>make -j 4</span> <span>sudo make
        install</span></p>
        <p>The <code>-j 4</code> is optional, to accelerate the build by using
        multiple processing threads. Replace the 4 with the number of "threads"
        or cores your CPU has.</p>
        <p>Various other options are available, run</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>cmake --help</span></p>
        <p>for details.</p>
        <h3>Debian &amp; Ubuntu</h3>
        <p>Up-to-date official Debian packages are not currently available, but
        packages from the <a href=
        "https://launchpad.net/~h-realh/+archive/roxterm">Ubuntu PPA</a> may be
        compatible, or you can take advantage of the debian build files
        provided.</p>
        <p>You can use <code>sudo apt-get build-dep roxterm</code> at this
        point, but depending on the version already in your distro the set of
        packages may be out-of-date, so be prepared for dependency errors later
        and install the necessary packages at that point.</p>
        <p>If not using a release snapshot it's a good idead to use
        <code>dch</code> to ensure the newest version number in
        <code>debian/changelog</code> has an appropriate version number eg what
        <code>./version.sh</code> generates in the file <code>version</code>,
        based on the output of <code>git describe</code>. Now you can build the
        packages eg with <code>debuild -b -uc -us</code>. Note the
        <code>-b</code>:- only binary packages can be built in the absence of
        an orig tarball.</p>

        <h1>Руководство пользователя</h1>
        <h2>Вкладки <a class="pageAnchor" name="Tabs" id="Tabs">:</a></h2>
        <p>Each window can contain a number of tabs, each with its own
        terminal. Unlike gnome-terminal and earlier versions of ROXTerm, the
        tab bar is always shown by default, even if there is only one tab, to
        avoid resizing inconsistencies, but this is configurable.</p>
        <p>If you experience a problem with tab labels shrinking after dragging
        tabs so that they only have room to display '...', try making sure the
        pointer is over the body of a terminal when you drop a dragged tab, not
        over the tab bar area.</p>
        <h2>Меню <a class="pageAnchor" name="Menus" id="Menus">:</a></h2>
        <p>When the menu bar is hidden the popup menu duplicates the same items
        as in the menu bar; this gives you full access to all the functions
        with the menu bar hidden. The menu bar is effectively redundant but
        provided to make ROXTerm appear more straightforward for first-time
        users. It can be turned on and off for a particular window or more
        permanently by using the configuration manager.</p>
        <p><a id="MainNav_Home" href="index.html" name="MainNav_Home">На
        главную</a></p>
        <h2>URI Highlighting <a class="pageAnchor" name="URIHighlighting" id=
        "URIHighlighting">:</a></h2>
        <p>When the pointer is over an address that ROXTerm recognises as a URI
        (typically a web URL or email address) it is highlighted by underlining
        and a change of pointer shape. You can open the address either by
        right-clicking on it and choosing Open... in the menu or by holding
        Ctrl and left-clicking. The applications used to handle these addresses
        may be set with the configuration tool, otherwise it will try to find a
        suitable default. Also by holding Ctrl you can drag a URI to pass it to
        another application which is willing to accept it as a URI or text;
        dragging it into the same window it came from pastes the address back
        in.</p>
        <p>Note that if the pointer is over the server address portion of a URL
        it only highlights the address, omitting the filename; move the pointer
        over the filename to get the whole URL. Similarly you can highlight an
        email address with or without a leading mailto:.</p>
        <p>As of version 2.9.1 ssh URI and hostname matching is supported. URIs
        including a path name can only be copied to the clipboard; in the
        absence of a pathname ROXTerm can also start a ssh session to the
        described host. Plain hostnames are also matched, but only if they
        start with "ssh" or end with ".local" or ".lan". Attempting to match
        more generic hostnames would cause too many false positives. If you
        regularly use a non-matching ssh server consider adding a matching
        alias in /etc/hosts.</p>
        <h2>Drag &amp; Drop <a class="pageAnchor" name="DragAndDrop" id=
        "DragAndDrop">:</a></h2>
        <p>You can now drag items onto terminal windows. Text objects are fed
        to the terminal as if typed. Files and URIs have their location
        (filename or URI) fed in rather than the object's contents. Graphical
        files can also be dragged onto the appropriate area of the
        configuration manager to set terminal background images. Holding down
        Ctrl while dragging a highlighted URI allows the address to be dragged
        to another application.</p>
        <p>You can now drag tabs by their labels to reorder them within a
        window or to move them to another ROXTerm window or, by dropping them
        outside a ROXTerm window, move tabs to new windows of their own. Use
        mouse button 3 (the right button) to move an unselected tab without
        selecting it. Note that versions prior to 1.9 used button 2 (middle).
        Button 2 is now a shortcut to paste the contents of the clipboard as
        the tab's name.</p>
        <h2>Named User Sessions <a class="pageAnchor" name="Sessions" id=
        "Sessions">:</a></h2>
        <p>New in version 3.1.1 is the ability to save named user sessions.
        Click Save Session... in the File menu to name your session and save
        it. A session saves the state of current windows and tabs but not the
        terminals' text content. A session can be restored with roxterm's
        --session command-line option, or will be restored automatically if
        named 'Default'. Leaving the field blank is equivalent to
        'Default'.</p>
        <h2>Настройка <a class="pageAnchor" name="Configuration" id=
        "Configuration">:</a></h2>
        <p>Configuration is based on named profiles so you can save different
        sets of options and switch between them quickly. There are profiles for
        general options, colour schemes and keyboard shortcuts (sometimes also
        referred to as accelerators). Colour Schemes and Profiles apply to one
        tab at a time, but Keyboard Shortcuts apply to all tabs in the same
        window to avoid the potential for confusion from different tabs having
        different shortcuts for switching tabs. New windows and tabs inherit
        settings from the window/tab they were opened from.</p>
        <p>Prior to version 1.15.1 all tabs had to share the same Profile, but
        this has been changed. In consequence a profile's font and other
        settings which affect a terminal's size may be overridden to keep
        geometry consistent across a number of tabs in one window.</p>
        <p>The Preferences menu allows you to select the current profile etc
        (this setting will not be remembered; use the configuration manager to
        set the defaults), open the configuration manager to edit the current
        profile or colour scheme or to manage all settings. In the
        configuration manager you can select one of the four types of option
        groups and edit, copy, delete or rename it. Each item also has a radio
        button. The item with the selected radio is the default for new
        terminals. Note that character encodings are handled slightly
        differently.</p>
        <h2>Сочетания клавиш <a class="pageAnchor" name="KeyboardShortcuts" id=
        "KeyboardShortcuts">:</a></h2>
        <p>There is no editor for keyboard shortcuts; instead, prior to GTK+
        3.10 they can be changed by pressing keys while the mouse is hovering
        over a menu item in the terminal. This feature must be enabled with the
        "Enable editing" option under the "Keyboard shortcuts" section of the
        <a href="#ConfigurationManagement">Configuration Manager</a>. There is
        also a "hidden" global GNOME setting to determine whether GTK
        applications can have their shortcuts edited in this way. The global
        option is managed by gconf, which roxterm is not linked with, so in
        some circumstances the global and roxterm options may conflict with
        each other.</p>
        <p>The above method for editing shortcuts has been disabled from GTK+
        3.10 onwards. Instead ROXTerm 2.9.1 onwards allows the shortcuts
        profiles to be edited in a text editor, either via the Configuration
        Manager or from a terminal's menu (Preferences submenu). The action
        names correspond to the localised labels used in the menu items. The
        new shortcuts should automatically be reloaded when you save the file.
        Alternatively, selecting a scheme in the Preferences menu now forces it
        to be reloaded.</p>
        <p>If you have GTK+ 3.10 or newer, but can't upgrade from an older
        ROXTerm you will have to open the config files in a text editor
        yourself, then restart roxterm. The default file is
        ~/.config/roxterm.sourceforge.net/Shortcuts/Default. If one does not
        already exist you can copy the Default file provided with roxterm and
        use it as a template. This can be found as Config/Shortcuts/Default in
        the source tree, or /usr/share/roxterm/Config/Shortcuts/Default in most
        installed packages.</p>
        <h2>Configuration Management <a class="pageAnchor" name=
        "ConfigurationManagement" id="ConfigurationManagement">:</a></h2>
        <p>You can also run the configuration manager by selecting
        "Configure..." in ROX's menu for the ROXTerm application or by running
        roxterm-config if ROXTerm has been installed conventionally.</p>
        <p>Configuration files can easily be swapped with other users. Each
        profile, colour scheme and keyboard shortcut scheme has a single file
        associated with it; saving a valid file in the appropriate directory
        will create a profile etc with the same name as the file.</p>
        <p>The directory locations for these configuration files follow the XDG
        Base Directory specification. In descending order of priority they
        are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><span>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/roxterm.sourceforge.net defaulting to
          ~/.config/roxterm.sourceforge.net</span></li>
          <li><span>${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS}/roxtem.sourceforge.net defaulting to
          /etc/xdg/roxtem.sourceforge.net</span></li>
          <li><span>ROXTerm/Config for ROX users, or ${datadir}/roxterm/Config
          for others; ${datadir} is usually /usr/share for packages or
          /usr/local/share when compiled from source</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Files will be loaded from any and all the above locations; files in
        high priority locations shadow ones with the same name in lower
        priority locations. Files are only saved in the first location.</p>
        <p>Within any or each of those locations, profiles are saved in a
        "Profiles" subdirectory, colour schemes in "Colours" and keyboard
        shortcut schemes in "Shortcuts". A file called "Globals" contains
        miscellaneous options which don't fall into the above categories,
        including the default profile etc for new terminals.</p>

        all terminals so that you can drag tabs between windows. If you run the
        command again it sends a D-BUS message to the existing process to
        signal it to open a new terminal, and the second process exits. To make
        a roxterm command run in its own separate process use the --separate
        option.</p>
        <p>Note that the --colour_scheme and --shortcut_scheme options have
        been replaced by --colour-scheme and --shortcut-scheme respectively in
        1.7.0 (underscores changed to hyphens) but the old versions remain
        usable for backwards compatibility.</p>
        <h2>GTK Styling <a class="pageAnchor" name="GtkStyling" id=
        "GtkStyling">:</a></h2>
        <p>Like any VTE-based terminal, you can apply custom GTK styles on
        ROXTerm terminals.</p>
        <p>A common use-case is to add padding around the terminal content. You
        can do this by adding the following to your global GTK stylesheet in
        ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>VteTerminal,</span> <span>vte-terminal
        {</span> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;-VteTerminal-inner-border: 20px;</span>
        <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 20px;</span> <span>}</span></p>
        <p>Per-profile styling is possible by targeting specific classes in the
        GTK stylesheet. For example, if you want to apply a different padding
        to a profile named "Minimal", while still keeping your default padding,
        you can add this style rule after the previous one:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>VteTerminal.roxterm-Minimal,</span>
        <span>vte-terminal.roxterm-Minimal {</span>
        <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;-VteTerminal-inner-border: 2px;</span>
        <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 2px;</span> <span>}</span></p>
        <p>When a profile name contains spaces, the generated class replaces
        them with hyphens.</p>
        <h2>Advanced D-Bus Usage <a class="pageAnchor" name="AdvancedDbusUsage"
        id="AdvancedDbusUsage">:</a></h2>
        <p>From version 1.14.0 advanced users can use D-Bus to configure
        terminals from other applications and scripts. There are three D-Bus
        methods especially for this purpose; they require an id code to target
        a specific terminal; each terminal's id code can be read from the
        environment variable ROXTERM_ID in the shell/application running in it.
        The D-Bus object path and interface for the methods are
        "net.sf.roxterm.Options" and "/net/sf/roxterm/Options" respectively.
        The methods are:</p>
        <p class="snippet">SetProfile("id", "profile_name")</p>
        <p>Ask the terminal to use the named profile. Note that any other tabs
        in the same window will be updated to the same new profile. All tabs in
        one window must have the same profile so that their font size and
        therefore terminal size remain consistent.</p>
        <p class="snippet">SetColourScheme("id", "scheme_name")</p>
        <p>Ask the terminal to use the named colour scheme. Tabs sharing the
        same window may have different colour schemes from each other.</p>
        <p class="snippet">SetShortcutScheme("id", "scheme_name")</p>
        <p>Ask the terminal to use the named keyboard shortcut scheme. Tabs
        sharing the same window must also share the same shortcut scheme.</p>
        <p>Example using dbus-send in a shell script:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>dbus-send --session /net/sf/roxterm/Options
        \</span> <span>net.sf.roxterm.Options.SetColourScheme
        string:$ROXTERM_ID string:GTK</span></p>
        <p>You may also send D-Bus signals to change individual options within
        a named profile or colour scheme using the methods StringOption,
        IntOption (also used for boolean options) and FloatOption. All
        terminals using the named profile or colour scheme are affected, but
        only temporarily. The options are not saved for new terminals. The
        methods all take 3 arguments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Full profile name, including a prefix of "Profiles/" or
          "Colours/"</span></li>
          <li><span>Option name</span></li>
          <li><span>Value</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To see which option names you can use, check the config files, from
        which the types can be deduced.</p>
        <p>Example using dbus-send in a shell script:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>dbus-send --session /net/sf/roxterm/Options
        \</span> <span>net.sf.roxterm.Options.StringOption \</span>
        <span>string:Colours/GTK string:background 'string:#ffffff'</span></p>
        <p>A third possible use is to notify roxterm that a profile, colour
        scheme or shortcuts scheme has been changed by an external program and
        all terminals using that profile etc need to reload it:</p>
        <p class="snippet">OptionsChanged("family_name", "profile_name")</p>
        <p>where family_name is one of "Profiles", "Colours" or "Shortcuts".
        For example:</p>
        <p class="snippet"><span>dbus-send --session /net/sf/roxterm/Options
        \</span> <span>net.sf.roxterm.Options.OptionsChanged \</span>
        <span>string:Profiles string:Default</span></p>
