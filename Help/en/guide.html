				<h1>User Guide</h1>

				<h2>Tabs <a class="pageAnchor" name="Tabs">:</a></h2>

				<p>Each window can contain a number of tabs, each with its own terminal. Unlike gnome-terminal and earlier
				versions of ROXTerm, the tab bar is always shown by default, even if there is only one tab, to avoid resizing
				inconsistencies, but this is configurable.</p>

				<h2>Menus <a class="pageAnchor" name="Menus">:</a></h2>

				<p>When the menu bar is hidden the popup menu duplicates the same items as in the menu bar; this gives you full
				access to all the functions with the menu bar hidden. The menu bar is effectively redundant but provided to make
				ROXTerm appear more straightforward for first-time users. It can be turned on and off for a particular window or
				more permanently by using the configuration manager.</p>

				<p>The popup menu also allows email and web addresses to be opened in external applications if such an address is
				highlighted by the pointer being over it.</p>

				<h2>URI Highlighting <a class="pageAnchor" name="URIHighlighting">:</a></h2>

				<p>When the pointer is over an address that ROXTerm recognises as a URI (typically a web URL or email address) it
				is highlighted by underlining and a change of pointer shape. You can open the address either by right-clicking on
				it and choosing Open... in the menu or by holding Ctrl and left-clicking. The applications used to handle these
				addresses may be set with the configuration tool, otherwise it will try to find a suitable default. Also by holding
				Ctrl you can drag a URI to pass it to another application which is willing to accept it as a URI or text; dragging
				it into the same window it came from pastes the address back in.</p>

				<p>Note that if the pointer is over the server address portion of a URL it only highlights the address, omitting
				the filename; move the pointer over the filename to get the whole URL. Similarly you can highlight an email address
				with or without a leading mailto:.</p>

				<p>As of version 2.9.1 ssh URI and hostname matching is supported. URIs including a path name can only be copied to
				the clipboard; in the absence of a pathname ROXTerm can also start a ssh session to the described host. Plain
				hostnames are also matched, but only if they start with "ssh" or end with ".local" or ".lan". Attempting to match
				more generic hostnames would cause too many false positives. If you regularly use a non-matching ssh server
				consider adding a matching alias in /etc/hosts.</p>

				<h2>Drag &amp; Drop <a class="pageAnchor" name="DragAndDrop">:</a></h2>

				<p>You can now drag items onto terminal windows. Text objects are fed to the terminal as if typed. Files and URIs
				have their location (filename or URI) fed in rather than the object's contents. Graphical files can also be dragged
				onto the appropriate area of the configuration manager to set terminal background images. Holding down Ctrl while
				dragging a highlighted URI allows the address to be dragged to another application.</p>

				<p>You can now drag tabs by their labels to reorder them within a window or to move them to another ROXTerm window
				or, by dropping them outside a ROXTerm window, move tabs to new windows of their own. Use mouse button 3 (the right
				button) to move an unselected tab without selecting it. Note that versions prior to 1.9 used button 2 (middle).
				Button 2 is now a shortcut to paste the contents of the clipboard as the tab's name.</p>

				<h2>Configuration <a class="pageAnchor" name="Configuration">:</a></h2>

				<p>Configuration is based on named profiles so you can save different sets of options and switch between them
				quickly. There are profiles for general options, colour schemes and keyboard shortcuts (sometimes also referred
				to as accelerators). Colour Schemes and Profiles apply to one tab at a time, but Keyboard Shortcuts apply to all
				tabs in the same window to avoid the potential for confusion from different tabs having different shortcuts for
				switching tabs. New windows and tabs inherit settings from the window/tab they were opened from.</p>

				<p>Prior to version 1.15.1 all tabs had to share the same Profile, but this has been changed. In consequence a
				profile's font and other settings which affect a terminal's size may be overridden to keep geometry consistent
				across a number of tabs in one window.</p>

				<p>The Preferences menu allows you to select the current profile etc (this setting will not be remembered; use the
				configuration manager to set the defaults), open the configuration manager to edit the current profile or colour
				scheme or to manage all settings. In the configuration manager you can select one of the four types of option
				groups and edit, copy, delete or rename it. Each item also has a radio button. The item with the selected radio
				is the default for new terminals. Note that character encodings are handled slightly differently. </p>

				<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts <a class="pageAnchor" name="KeyboardShortcuts">:</a></h2>

				<p>There is no editor for keyboard shortcuts; instead, prior to GTK+ 3.10 they can be changed by pressing keys while the mouse is
				hovering over a menu item in the terminal. This feature must be enabled with the "Enable editing" option under
				the "Keyboard shortcuts" section of the <a href="#ConfigurationManagement">Configuration Manager</a>. There is
				also a "hidden" global GNOME setting to determine whether GTK applications can have their shortcuts edited in this
				way. The global option is managed by gconf, which roxterm is not linked with, so in some circumstances the global
				and roxterm options may conflict with each other.</p>

				<p>The above method for editing shortcuts has been disabled from GTK+ 3.10 onwards. Instead ROXTerm 2.9.1 onwards allows
				the shortcuts profiles to be edited in a text editor, either via the Configuration Manager or from a terminal's menu
				(Preferences submenu). The action names correspond to the localised labels used in the menu items. The new shortcuts
				should automatically be reloaded when you save the file. Alternatively, selecting a scheme in the Preferences menu now
				forces it to be reloaded.</p>

				<p>If you have GTK+ 3.10 or newer, but can't upgrade from an older ROXTerm you will have to open the config files in a text
				editor yourself, then restart roxterm. The default file is ~/.config/roxterm.sourceforge.net/Shortcuts/Default. If one
				does not already exist you can copy the Default file provided with roxterm and use it as a template. This can be found as
				Config/Shortcuts/Default in the source tree, or /usr/share/roxterm/Config/Shortcuts/Default in most installed packages.</p>

				<h2>Configuration Management <a class="pageAnchor" name="ConfigurationManagement">:</a></h2>

				<p>You can also run the configuration manager by selecting "Configure..." in ROX's menu for the ROXTerm application
				or by running roxterm-config if ROXTerm has been installed conventionally.</p>

				<p>Configuration files can easily be swapped with other users. Each profile, colour scheme and keyboard shortcut
				scheme has a single file associated with it; saving a valid file in the appropriate directory will create a profile
				etc with the same name as the file.</p>

				<p>The directory locations for these configuration files follow the XDG Base Directory specification. In descending
				order of priority they are:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><span>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/roxterm.sourceforge.net defaulting to ~/.config/roxterm.sourceforge.net</span></li>
					<li><span>${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS}/roxtem.sourceforge.net defaulting to /etc/xdg/roxtem.sourceforge.net</span></li>
					<li><span>ROXTerm/Config for ROX users, or ${datadir}/roxterm/Config for others; ${datadir} is usually /usr/share for packages
					or /usr/local/share when compiled from source</span></li>
				</ol>

				<p>Files will be loaded from any and all the above locations; files in high priority locations shadow ones with the same name in lower priority locations.
				Files are only saved in the first location.</p>

				<p>Within any or each of those locations, profiles are saved in a "Profiles" subdirectory, colour schemes in
				"Colours" and keyboard shortcut schemes in "Shortcuts". A file called "Globals" contains miscellaneous options
				which don't fall into the above categories, including the default profile etc for new terminals.</p>

				<h2>Command-line Options <a class="pageAnchor" name="CommandlineOptions">:</a></h2>

				<p>ROXTerm accepts a number of command-line options. Run:</p>

				<p class="snippet">roxterm --help</p>

				<p>for a full list.</p>

				<p>From version 1.1.0 ROXTerm defaults to using only one process for all terminals so that you can drag tabs
				between windows. If you run the command again it sends a D-BUS message to the existing process to signal it to
				open a new terminal, and the second process exits. To make a roxterm command run in its own separate process use
				the --separate option.</p>

				<p>Note that the --colour_scheme and --shortcut_scheme options have been replaced by --colour-scheme and
				--shortcut-scheme respectively in 1.7.0 (underscores changed to hyphens) but the old versions remain usable for
				backwards compatibility.</p>


				<h2>Advanced D-Bus Usage <a class="pageAnchor" name="AdvancedDbusUsage">:</a></h2>

				<p>From version 1.14.0 advanced users can use D-Bus to configure terminals from other applications and scripts.
				There are three D-Bus methods especially for this purpose; they require an id code to target a specific terminal;
				each terminal's id code can be read from the environment variable ROXTERM_ID in the shell/application running in it.
				The D-Bus object path and interface for the methods are "net.sf.roxterm.Options" and "/net/sf/roxterm/Options"
				respectively. The methods are:</p>

				<p class="snippet">SetProfile("id", "profile_name")</p>
				<p>Ask the terminal to use the named profile. Note that any other tabs in the same window will be updated to the
				same new profile. All tabs in one window must have the same profile so that their font size and therefore terminal
				size remain consistent.</p>

				<p class="snippet">SetColourScheme("id", "scheme_name")</p>
				<p>Ask the terminal to use the named colour scheme. Tabs sharing the same window may have different colour schemes
				from each other.</p>

				<p class="snippet">SetShortcutScheme("id", "scheme_name")</p>
				<p>Ask the terminal to use the named keyboard shortcut scheme. Tabs sharing the same window must also share the
				same shortcut scheme.</p>

				<p>Example using dbus-send in a shell script:</p>

				<p class="snippet">
					<span>dbus-send --session /net/sf/roxterm/Options \</span>
					<span>net.sf.roxterm.Options.SetColourScheme string:$ROXTERM_ID string:GTK</span>
				</p>

				<p>You may also send D-Bus signals to change individual options within a named profile or colour scheme using the
				methods StringOption, IntOption (also used for boolean options) and FloatOption. All terminals using the named
				profile or colour scheme are affected, but only temporarily. The options are not saved for new terminals. The
				methods all take 3 arguments:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span>Full profile name, including a prefix of "Profiles/" or "Colours/"</span></li>
					<li><span>Option name</span></li>
					<li><span>Value</span></li>
				</ul>

				<p>To see which option names you can use, check the config files, from which the types can be deduced.</p>

				<p>Example using dbus-send in a shell script:</p>

				<p class="snippet">
					<span>dbus-send --session /net/sf/roxterm/Options \</span>
					<span>net.sf.roxterm.Options.StringOption \</span>
					<span>string:Colours/GTK string:background 'string:#ffffff'</span>
				</p>

				<p>A third possible use is to notify roxterm that a profile, colour scheme or shortcuts scheme has been changed by
				an external program and all terminals using that profile etc need to reload it:</p>

				<p class="snippet">OptionsChanged("family_name", "profile_name")</p>
				<p>where family_name is one of "Profiles", "Colours" or "Shortcuts". For example:</p>

				<p class="snippet">
					<span>dbus-send --session /net/sf/roxterm/Options \</span>
					<span>net.sf.roxterm.Options.OptionsChanged \</span>
					<span>string:Profiles string:Default</span>
