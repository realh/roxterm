"ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features to "
"gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library. It was originally designed to "
"have a smaller footprint and quicker start-up time by not using the Gnome "
"libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the configuration GUI, "
"but thanks to all the features it's acquired over the years ROXTerm can "
"probably now be accused of bloat. However, it is more configurable than "
"gnome-terminal and aimed more at \"power\" users who make heavy use of "
"terminals."
